# Analysis of delivery time and its dependence on various factors

Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatkumar30/food-delivery-time/code
In this team project we discover such questions:
- How does vehicle type influence delivery speed?
- How does type of order influence delivery speed?


Also, we tested hypotheses - whether mean delivery speed of people under 30 is less than mean delivery speed of people over 30.
